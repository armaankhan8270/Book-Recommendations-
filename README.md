# Book Recommendation System

## Introduction

The **Book Recommendation System** is a web application built using Python and Flask that suggests books to users based on various machine learning algorithms. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to provide personalized book recommendations. 

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of machine learning techniques in a real-world application and to offer users an engaging and useful experience in discovering new books.

## Features

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends books based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends books based on the user's previously liked books.
- **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for books by title or author.
- **User Authentication:** Users can create an account, log in, and view personalized recommendations.
- **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly web interface built with Flask and Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The main programming language for the backend logic and machine learning.
- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for Python.
- **Pandas and Numpy:** Libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **SQLAlchemy:** For database operations.
- **Bootstrap:** For front-end styling.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv` or `virtualenv`)
- SQLite (or any other SQL database)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommendation-system.git
    cd book-recommendation-system
    ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up the Database:**
    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
    flask db upgrade
    ```

5. **Run the Application:**
